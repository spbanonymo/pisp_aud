# PISP: (Anonymous submission)

##
Visualizes:
- Continuous 360Â° listener motion around stationary source
- Dynamic left/right channel balance based on angular position
- PISP-generated impulse responses for listener-source pair (view direction in all is fixed at 90 degrees)

Demonstrates:
- Doppler effect during listener along axis (distance attenuation)
- Energy balance on relative positions (elevation is kept fixed on purpose).
